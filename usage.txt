* Introduction

  This document is a brief description of a rate monitor for Linux
  which can be used to monitor the data rate of a network interface.

  The rate monitor will sample the traffic on the specified network
  interface and estimate the parameters of a log-normal
  distribution.

  The monitor can be run in two modes.

  1. A standalone program recording the data from the
     monitor (i.e. traffic rates and estimation parameters) in a text
     file in JSON format and/or sending the data to a local TCP port.
     (The latter is for integration with DoubleDecker in a Universal
     Node; see https://www.fp7-unify.eu/).

  2. Running in an OpenStack environment recording the monitor data in
     Ceilometer. (Se section "Storing the monitor data in Ceilometer"
     below).

  The mode is determined by the -f option or the -b option at startup.

* Dependencies of the monitor code

** Linux

   The monitor has been developed and tested for Ubuntu 14.04, but it will
   probably work on other modern Linux versions and distributions.

** Python version

   The monitor runs in Python 2.7.

   You must to change the first line in the files run_monitor.py and
   monconf.py if the path to your default Python installation does not
   match the one specified.

** Python pre-requisites

*** Requests

    The Requests HTTP library is used for communication with Ceilometer.

    Installation instructions:
    http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install

*** Scipy

    Installation instructions:
    http://scipy.org/install.html

*** sh

    Documentation: http://amoffat.github.io/sh/

    Install with pip:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ pip install sh
    #+END_EXAMPLE

* Known limitations and issues

** The timing for the sampling of the interface data counters is not very sophisticated.

    It is possible to sample about 1000 times per second,
    but the sampling rate will most likely vary somewhat.

** The rate monitor has not been tested for wireless interfaces.

** The rate monitor configuration port is hardcoded to 54736.

   This means that setting the --port option when running monconf.py
   will have no effect.

** Bad time synchronization between the rate monitor and Ceilometer may cause data loss.

   If the clocks on the computer running the rate monitor and the
   computer running Ceilometer differ too much, data may not be
   recorded in Ceilometer, and no error will be propagated to the
   rate monitor.

* <<Data stored by the rate monitor>>

  The data is stored in a JSON object with the following names.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   'timestamp':           Date and time when this data was recorded.
   'interface':           The network interface being monitored.
   'linerate':            The line rate in bytes per second of the interface being monitored.
   'alarm_trigger_value': The trigger value for the overload risk over which to set the alarm flag to True.
   'cutoff':              The percentage for the link speed to use in the overload risk estimation.
   'tx':                  The mean transmission rate during the last estimation period.
   'var_tx':              The variance of the transmission rate during last estimation period.
   'mu_tx':               The location parameter of the estimated log-normal distribution for outgoing traffic.
   'sigma2_tx':           The scale parameter of the estimated log-normal distribution for outgoing traffic.
   'overload_risk_tx':    The overload risk in percent: (1 - cdf) * 100, (cdf = cumulative density function) for outgoing traffic.
   'alarm_tx':            True or False.
   'rx':                  The mean reception rate during the last estimation period.
   'var_rx':              The variance of the reception rate during the last estimation period.
   'mu_rx':               The location parameter of the estimated log-normal distribution for incoming traffic.
   'sigma2_rx':           The scale parameter of the estimated log-normal distribution for incoming traffic.
   'overload_risk_rx':    The overload risk in percent: (1 - cdf) * 100 (cdf = cumulative density function) for incoming traffic.
   'alarm_rx':            True or False.
   'sample_rate':         The sample rate of the monitor.
   'estimation_interval': The estimation interval of the monitor.
   'meter_interval':      The metering interval of the monitor.
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  When the monitor is used in mode 1 it will store a sequence of such
  JSON objects in a file the user specified at startup and/or send
  the JSON objects data to a local TCP port.

  See the next section for how data is stored when the monitor is
  used in mode 2.

* Storing the monitor data in Ceilometer

   A minimal OpenStack installation of one controller node, running
   Ceilometer and its necessary support services, is sufficient for
   testing.

   The monitor can run on any computer that can connect to the
   Ceilometer node; on a physical computer or on a VM.

   We use the web API of Ceilometer to store metering data in
   Ceilometer.

   This is documented at
   http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ceilometer/webapi/v2.html#user-defined-data.

   More hints can be found at
   http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/section_telemetry-post-api.html
   and here:
   https://www.mirantis.com/blog/openstack-metering-using-ceilometer

   Storing the data in Ceilometer is done by a HTTP POST, with a JSON
   object as the data provided. See the code in the file
   ceilocomm.py, specifically the method putMeter(), for details.

** Required fields

   The required fields of the JSON data to store a meter are (values
   in this example are arbitrary):

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   "counter_name": "test",
   "user_id": "admin",
   "resource_id": "76799085-e0ff-4620-9b7f-120d3c51cc49",
   "counter_unit": "%",
   "counter_volume": 10.57762938230384,
   "project_id": "855f014353ec48d98ef7b887fc6980e1",
   "counter_type": "gauge"
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Contrary to the documentation mentioned above, project_id is a
   required field.

** Data stored by the meter

   All data from the rate monitor is stored in the resource_metadata
   field of the JSON data. See the section [[Data stored by the rate monitor]]
   for details of what data will be stored.

*** Example of meter data stored in Ceilometer

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   {
      "counter_name": "sdn_at_edge", 
      "user_id": "855f014353ec48d98ef7b887fc6980e1", 
      "resource_id": "76799085-e0ff-4620-9b7f-120d3c51cc49", 
      "timestamp": "2015-05-07T14:17:47.665000", 
      "counter_volume": 4711.0, 
      "resource_metadata": <a JSON object as described above>, 
      "source": "76799085-e0ff-4620-9b7f-120d3c51cc49:openstack", 
      "counter_unit": "b/s", 
      "recorded_at": "2015-05-07T14:17:47.678000", 
      "project_id": "76799085-e0ff-4620-9b7f-120d3c51cc49", 
      "message_id": "d62753ec-f4c3-11e4-9642-080027486ab1", 
      "counter_type": "gauge"
   }
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   timestamp, source, recorded_at, and message_id are added by the
   Ceilometer API, and should not be specified by the user of the API.

* Configuring the rate monitor

   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Configuration at run-time

   The rate monitor can be configured at run-time with 'monconf.py'.
   Do 'monconf.py -h' for a list of configuration parameters.

   These parameters can currently be configured:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   --pause                   Pause the rate monitor.
   --resume                  Resume the rate monitor.
   --status                  Show the status of the rate monitor.
   --exit                    Tell the rate monitor to exit.
                             Setting this option will cause all other options to be ignored.
   -i, --interface           Interface to monitor.
   -s, --sample_rate         Sample rate in samples per second.
   -e, --estimation_interval Estimation interval in seconds.
   -m, --meter_interval      Meter interval in seconds.
   -k, --link_speed          Set the link speed value for the monitored interface (in Mbits per second).
   -a, --alarm_trigger       The overload risk which will trigger an alarm (a percentage).
   -o, --cutoff              A percentage of the link speed to use in the overload risk calculation; default 99%.
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Other options for monconf.py:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   --host    IP or name of the computer running the rate monitor. Default is 127.0.0.1.
   --port    Port of the computer running the rate monitor. Default is 54736.
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The default port number is the port number currently hardwired
   into 'monitor.py' so no other portnumber will work.

* Starting the rate monitor

  Simply start run_monitor.py from a shell with the appropriate
  configuration parameters.

  With the debug flag the monitor will only display the metering data
  on in the controlling terminal and will not store data persistently.

* Stopping the rate monitor

  Use the --exit option of monconf.py or type ^C in the terminal
  running the rate monitor.
